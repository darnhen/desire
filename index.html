        <h1>Nothing Looks the Same in the Light</h1>
        <h2>by <i>Darnell Henderson</i> </h2>
        <p>When I find myself encountering a situation in which I cannot predict the outcome, I feel fear. I have always been someone who can conjure fear from any place: transforming the immaterial to a material I can look at. See, to look at chance is to look at warped reflection. One that haunts you as you lay in bed, seconds from sleep. Eyes closed in rejection, but this image stands erect, stands bright in your mind.</p>
        <br>
        <p>	I fear I won’t have anything to hold at the end of this. That I won’t have these morning hands touch me or that I won’t hold a face that feels too soft, as if it could melt. When I a kid, I apparently hated to be touched. My mom claims I would cry if she held me. My mom also recalls for me that I loved when a camera was pointed at me. That I would always return a smile. Even when I was crying. Tears collecting on the floor, but my frown would diminish into a smile. I sometimes wish I possessed these qualities still: an ability to persevere, an ability to express what I didn’t like. I lazily wonder where this strength came from, where it is hiding. Why I would cite this as bravery when it was so innate to me that it did not need designation, just actions readily available. If I could harness these qualities now, I would smile without tears.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There is a hard divide between deciding to fall over in hope or remaining silently tucked away. I often think of the music I listened to in high school and how it can be categorized, in absolute terms, by its heartbreak. Across any genre, I had a penchant for finding what hurt and holding it so close to me it was as if I had experienced it too. Felt motivated to find what also resided in me; match two ruins to each other and call them the indistinguishable. And in these ruins, I would hide as if to constantly reconcile with love as a pathway for destruction, but I find this consoling funny. I had not experienced love, in a requited sense, so I had not experienced love at its end. Had not gotten to the point in which I could look back and reach for days that were walking dreams. Hope by Blood Orange featuring Tei Shi and Puff Daddy is a song I return to in this moment. In the interlude, Puff Daddy discusses the love he wants, but will not allow himself to receive. He aches for the day that he is able to evade his fear and rush, grasp, and drink what will fill his person. We share this, I suppose, a fear that pauses limbs and tongues. And it’s as if I read my hesitation as a prediction of failure. As love’s hidden expiration forewarned by a heap of heartbreak songs that I keep stored for daily use.</p>
        <br>
        <p>	Wants are negotiations between two people. If I refer to the world inside me and I ask you to follow the script line for line, action by action? How about smile followed by smile, touch instigating more touch? Let’s not forget about the hunger I’ll have for you and the hunger you’ll have for me. Could you do all of that? With insistence, I ask nicely because there is a world inside of me very similar to the one that exists and responds to my tactility. Yours too, but mine is commanded by me, succumbs to me. This world is the result of my desires that whine informing me to feed it, or some other force will bite. If I could accept an approximate reality hosted by some of my wants, I would instruct you to find something that throbs in the center of my chest. Ask that you hold it and carry it with a light touch.</p>
        <br>
        <p>	Chance is the monster I imagine in my closet. The one that has followed me since childhood. The reason I still close my closet doors regardless of where I have lived. This monster that I feel lingering is one I have not been able to conquer; a manifested fear that I’ve given an amorphous lifespan, breath, and texture. Why am I not braver? I wish I could see chance as a game. As cards in hand, knowing that loss is an assured play, but still triumphantly laughing as I reveal my hand. When I play, I hope to see you on the other side. </p>
